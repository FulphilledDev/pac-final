            <p className='mb-3'>
              Our work starts with a thorough diagnostic examination of your
              heating and cooling system. We check the age of your units and
              look into the frequency of your problems to determine how reliable
              your equipment is. We also look for warning signs of common
              problems and test different parts to see how well they’re
              functioning.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-3'>
              From there, we are able to provide a clear explanation of the
              problem upfront. We include an estimate of the cost so there will
              be no surprises when it comes time to pay your bill. After you
              sign off on the work, we perform the repairs quickly and get them
              done right the first time.

            <p className='mb-3'>
              Most air conditioners have a lifespan of 10+ years. If your unit
              is around this age or you call for repairs more than twice a year,
              it might be time to consider a replacement.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-3'>
              At Patriot Air Conditioning, we can help you choose a new unit to
              replace your existing AC. Whether you want central air or a
              ductless mini-split system, we’ll recommend the make and model
              that fits your budget and your needs.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-3'>
              When our expert installers replace your furnace or air
              conditioner, they do so as quickly as possible to reduce downtime
              and avoid extreme temperatures in your home. We can install a new
              HVAC unit for both residential and commercial buildings. All new
              ductwork and sheet metal fittings are fabricated and customized
              specifically for your system, complete with air-tight fittings for
              maximum efficiency.
